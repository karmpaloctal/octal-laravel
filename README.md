MySql doesn't support this because databases don't generally support it. The increments() and bigIncrements() column types cannot be used multiple times in the same table Schema

    Body request  restrictions  : headers Content-Type 

    I have create CURL function on Controller Class and use in HomeController class 

Address issue : 
    If you need get city name form the address add address datatype (json) and use whereJsonContains(Table.fieldname,value) in query 

Array search  : array search return array key
